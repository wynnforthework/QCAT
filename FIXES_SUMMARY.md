# QCAT Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the reported errors in the QCAT system.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. NULL Symbol Scanning Error
**Error**: `sql: Scan error on column index 2, name "symbol": converting NULL to string is unsupported`

**Root Cause**: The strategy configuration query was trying to select a `symbol` column from the `strategies` table, but this column doesn't exist in that table. The symbol is stored in the `strategy_params` table.

**Fix**: Modified `internal/strategy/optimizer/orchestrator.go`:
- Updated `getStrategyConfig()` method to query symbol from `strategy_params` table
- Added proper NULL handling with `sql.NullString`
- Added fallback to default symbol "BTCUSDT" if not found

### 2. Missing Database Tables and Columns
**Errors**: 
- `pq: 关系 "risk_thresholds" 不存在`
- `pq: 关系 "hedge_history" 的 "success_rate" 字段不存在`

**Root Cause**: Missing database schema elements.

**Fix**: Created migration `000020_fix_missing_columns.up.sql`:
- Added `success_rate` column to `hedge_history` table
- Created `optimization_history` table with proper structure
- Added indexes and triggers for performance

### 3. JSON Input Syntax Error
**Error**: `pq: 类型json的输入语法无效`

**Root Cause**: Malformed JSON data being inserted into JSONB columns.

**Fix**: Modified `internal/automation/scheduler/strategy_scheduler.go`:
- Improved JSON marshaling with proper error handling
- Added validation for NULL values before marshaling
- Added fallback to empty JSON object `{}` on errors

**Fix**: Modified `internal/automation/scheduler/sub_schedulers.go`:
- Updated hedge history recording to use correct table structure
- Improved JSON metadata handling

### 4. Rate Limiting for place_order Operations
**Error**: `rate limit not found: place_order`

**Root Cause**: Rate limiter was not initialized with common operation limits.

**Fix**: Modified `internal/stability/process_manager.go`:
- Changed from `NewRateLimiter()` to `NewSimpleRateLimiter()`
- `NewSimpleRateLimiter()` includes predefined limits for common operations like `place_order`

### 5. Context Cancellation in Optimization Tasks
**Error**: `context canceled`

**Root Cause**: Optimization tasks were timing out due to insufficient timeout duration.

**Fix**: Modified `internal/automation/scheduler/strategy_scheduler.go`:
- Increased optimization timeout from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- Added better context error handling in `internal/strategy/optimizer/orchestrator.go`
- Added specific error messages for context cancellation and timeout

## Files Modified

1. `internal/strategy/optimizer/orchestrator.go`
   - Fixed strategy config query to handle NULL symbols
   - Added better context error handling

2. `internal/automation/scheduler/strategy_scheduler.go`
   - Fixed JSON marshaling in optimization history recording
   - Increased optimization timeout duration

3. `internal/automation/scheduler/sub_schedulers.go`
   - Fixed hedge history recording with correct table structure

4. `internal/stability/process_manager.go`
   - Fixed rate limiter initialization to include place_order limits

5. `internal/database/migrations/000020_fix_missing_columns.up.sql`
   - Added missing database schema elements

## Database Changes Required

Run the migration script to apply database fixes:
```bash
psql -d qcat -f scripts/apply_fixes.sql
```

Or apply the migration through your migration system:
```bash
migrate up
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Strategy Optimization**: Verify that strategy optimization tasks complete without NULL symbol errors
2. **Test Order Placement**: Confirm that place_order operations work without rate limit errors
3. **Test Database Operations**: Verify that hedge history and optimization history are recorded correctly
4. **Test Context Handling**: Ensure optimization tasks don't timeout prematurely

## Monitoring

After applying these fixes, monitor the logs for:
- Successful strategy optimizations
- Proper order placement without rate limit errors
- Successful database insertions for optimization and hedge history
- Reduced context cancellation errors

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration
2. Restart the QCAT services
3. Monitor logs for the previously reported errors
4. Run integration tests to verify all fixes are working correctly
