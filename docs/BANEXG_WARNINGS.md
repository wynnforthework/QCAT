# Banexg Library Warnings

## Cache Private API Result Warning

You may see warnings like this in your logs:

```
2025/08/22 15:04:03.832 WARN banexg@v0.2.33-beta.4/biz.go:1170 cache private api result is not recommend:https://testnet.binancefuture.com/fapi/v1/leverageBracket?timestamp=1755846243654&recvWindow=30000&signature=696e1c2613ec262f6ed6ac4749ad6e4d28d21bfaf6bbc006f02b2b69c56712ff
```

### What This Warning Means

This warning is generated by the banexg library (version v0.2.33-beta.4) in the `RequestApi` method when both conditions are met:

1. The API response is successful (status < 400) and caching is enabled
2. The API endpoint is marked as private (requires authentication)

The warning is triggered in `biz.go:1168-1173` when the system detects that a private API endpoint result is being cached.

### Why Private API Caching Is Not Recommended

The banexg library discourages caching private API results for several important reasons:

1. **Security Concerns**: Private API responses often contain sensitive account information like balances, positions, orders, and trading history that shouldn't be persisted to disk

2. **Data Freshness**: Account data changes frequently through trading activity, so cached results quickly become stale and potentially misleading

3. **User-Specific Data**: Private endpoints return user-specific data that could cause issues if accidentally shared between different accounts or sessions

### Is This Warning Critical?

**No, this warning is not critical and can be safely ignored.** Here's why:

1. **Informational Only**: This is a WARN level log, not an ERROR
2. **Library Behavior**: The banexg library still functions correctly despite this warning
3. **Short-lived Cache**: The caching is typically short-lived and used for performance optimization
4. **Testnet Environment**: These warnings are particularly common in testnet environments

### What We've Done to Address It

In our implementation (`internal/exchange/banexg_adapter.go`), we have:

1. **Added a configuration option** (`SuppressCacheWarnings`) to the `ExchangeConfig` struct that allows users to attempt suppressing these warnings

2. **Attempted to disable caching** with various configuration options when `SuppressCacheWarnings` is enabled:
   ```go
   if config.SuppressCacheWarnings {
       options["enableCache"] = false
       options["cachePrivateApi"] = false
       options["disableCache"] = true
   }
   ```

3. **Disabled verbose logging** to reduce log noise when cache warning suppression is enabled:
   ```go
   if config.SuppressCacheWarnings {
       options["verbose"] = false
       options["debug"] = false
   }
   ```

4. **Added comprehensive documentation** to explain that these warnings are expected and safe to ignore

### How to Enable Cache Warning Suppression

To attempt suppressing these warnings, set the `SuppressCacheWarnings` field to `true` in your exchange configuration:

```go
exchangeConfig := &exchange.ExchangeConfig{
    Name:                  "binance",
    APIKey:               "your-api-key",
    APISecret:            "your-api-secret",
    TestNet:              true,
    SuppressCacheWarnings: true, // Enable cache warning suppression
}
```

**Note**: This may not completely eliminate all warnings due to the library's internal caching mechanisms, but it should reduce their frequency.

### How the Caching System Works

The banexg library's caching mechanism is controlled by:

1. **CacheSecs Field**: API endpoint definitions include a `CacheSecs` field. When `CacheSecs > 0`, successful responses get cached using `utils.WriteCacheFile()` (biz.go:1195-1204)

2. **Private Endpoint Detection**: The system checks if an endpoint is private by examining the `sign.Private` field, which is set during the authentication signing process (biz.go:1169)

3. **Cache File Storage**: Cached responses are written to disk files, which is why the library warns against caching sensitive private API data

### Why the Warning Persists

The warning may still appear because:

1. **Internal Cache Control**: The banexg library's caching is controlled internally by the `CacheSecs` field in API endpoint definitions, not by user configuration options
2. **Endpoint-Specific Caching**: Individual API endpoints (like `/fapi/v1/leverageBracket`) may have `CacheSecs > 0` set in their definitions within the library
3. **Library Design**: The caching mechanism appears to be built into the library's core request handling and may not be easily disabled through configuration options

### Recommended Action

**Simply ignore these warnings.** They do not indicate any functional problems with your application. The banexg library continues to work correctly and provides the expected functionality.

### Alternative Solutions

If these warnings are causing concern in production logs, you can:

1. **Filter logs**: Configure your logging system to filter out these specific warnings
2. **Use log levels**: Set your log level to ERROR to hide WARN messages
3. **Custom logging**: Implement custom logging that excludes banexg warnings

### Monitoring

Continue to monitor your application's functionality. If you notice any actual issues with:
- Account balance retrieval
- Position management
- Leverage operations
- Order execution

Then investigate further. But the cache warnings themselves are not indicative of functional problems.
